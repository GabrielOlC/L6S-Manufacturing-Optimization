## 🏭 The Challenge

A plastic bag manufacturing line was suffering from severe operational inefficiency. 

* **The Symptom:** Massive daily scrap generation per machine.
* **The Issue:** Frequent machine jams required constant manual intervention and resets, causing both material waste and production downtime.
* **The Constraint:** Zero historical data or machine documentation existed. The process relied entirely on "tribal knowledge" and reactive adjustments.
* **Project Objective:** Ys: Reduction of the material waste on the sector in 80%; ys: reduction of machinery ABD jams and, low- and high-level variability on final product measures. 
  
  

🔍 The Diagnostic Funnel
--------------------------------------------

Without sensor data or documentation, I had to innovate to understand the machine's behavior. I led the team in building a **Qualitative Analysis Framework** to funnel "tribal knowledge" into testable engineering hypotheses:

* **Mapping the Unknown (SIPOC & Flowcharts):** We documented the undocumented. By mapping the "as-is" physical process, we isolated the exact operational stages where waste was being generated.

* **Extracting Tribal Knowledge (Ishikawa):** I facilitated Fishbone diagnostic sessions with veteran operators to extract their unwritten understanding of machine failures, breaking it down into issue areas.

* **Structuring the Logic (Thinking Map):** To document the decision-making breakdowns and guide the team's efforts I developed a custom logic tree.

* **Filtering the Noise (Prioritization Matrix):** As we couldn't test everything at once. I implemented a weighted scoring matrix methodology to test Impact vs. Effort and objectively rank our hypotheses, defining exactly which machine parameters required physical intervention in Phase 2.
  
  

## 🛠️ The Iterative Solution

Because of the complexity and lack of documentation, a single DMAIC pass was insufficient. The project evolved over nearly two years through three distinct, iterative phases:

### Phase 1: Diagnostic & Quick Wins (Team: University Group)

*Focus: Define, Measure, Analyze*

* Executed the initial qualitative analysis to map the problem space.
* Secured early stakeholder buy-in by optimizing the factory layout and production sequencing (e.g., eliminating 15meters of wasted operator motion to pack items).
* Formulated hypotheses for mechanical failures but reached a limit due to restricted system access and the academic timeframe.
* **Results:** Achieved a cleaner process and documented methodologies and hypotheses for deeper study.

### Phase 2: Hypothesis Testing & System Decoding (Team: Me + External Specialists)

*Focus: Improve, deeper Measure/Analyze, Improve*

* Coordinated multiple external specialists over several months to perform mechanical alignments, install new tooling, and test Phase 1 hypotheses.
* Collaborated with these specialists to gain administrative access and **decode the machine's undocumented parameter logic** (e.g., understanding the physical timings and automation mechanics of the transport claw).
* **Results:** Improved machine reliability, durability, and performance by confirming/acting on several Phase 1 hypotheses.

### Phase 3: Autonomous Optimization (Team: Me)

*Focus: iterative Measure/Analyze, Improve, Control*

* Taking full ownership, I continued to reverse-engineer the remaining unknown parameters through iterative testing.
* **Visual DOE (Design of Experiments):** I utilized **Slow-Motion Video Analysis** to observe the film's interaction with the machine mechanism. This allowed me to test single variables and visually map the cause-and-effect of the newly decoded parameters.
* **The "Reliability-First" Speed Boost:** By fully eliminating the jamming issue, the machine became autonomous. With a stable process, I pushed the machine to its engineered production limits.
* **Results:** Enhanced machine reliability, durability, performance and production by developing new maintenance and processes methodologies from the learnings from Phases 1 and 2.
  
  

📜 Sustainability
---------------------------

To ensure the 150% production gains were sustained, I formalized the reverse‑engineered knowledge into permanent artifacts:

* **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):** A comprehensive manual defining the “Golden Parameters,” setup and process methodologies.

* **Anomaly Report:** A structured log for operators to record out‑of‑spec events, feeding back into the continuous improvement loop.

* **Training:** Trained operator teams on the new process and management methodologies.
